        <p>I found Mondo, because I too was irritated with my bank. My money is important to me, but the digital experience of using it felt like an afterthought. So I started designing a better version, a completely digital bank. As I got more into the project and did more research, I found mondo, and I immediately wanted to get involved.</p>

        <p>Mondo is what I wanted to create, just a few years ahead of me. It’s a project focusing on a goal I believe in - banking should be better. If Mondo is creating the best account in the world, then I want to help you design it.</p>

        <h2 class="ta-c">What you're looking for in a designer</h2>
        <h3>Enjoy working in a team and be a nice person</h3>
<p>I currently work in a team of about 14 people, and have a great time doing it. On the wall we have a poster that says “Teamwork makes the dream work”, and it's definitely true.</p>

<h3>You have a portfolio you can show us with a variety of projects, from interactive products (mainly iOS and Android apps) to static materials</h3>


<p>A selection of my best work is just above. I’ve made a huge range of things, from video games for speedrunners, to viral websites, to infographics. I’m happy to talk in more detail about any specific project.</p>

<p>I don’t have any apps in my portfolio because I simply haven’t had the opportunity to design one yet. But I am very keen to, I’ve read the iOS human interface guidelines and Android Design Principles back to front multiple times.</p>

<h3>Understand that good design is not about trends but is built on top of principles and trade-offs. In other words, you have reasons to stand by your design decisions.</h3>


<p>I will happily defend and discuss any of my design decisions, and explain my thought process. That being said, I’m not my work, and taking (and giving) criticism is a vital part of designing. I’ve always found the best way to improve a design is to discuss it, particularly with users.</p>

<h3>You are passionate about making beautiful visuals, but it’s not what drives you. What drives you is delivering great experiences and solving problems.</h3>

<p>Making things look beautiful is very fun, and worthwhile, but it’s just the icing on the cake. Design is so much about what happens before that step - user research, task analysis, wireframing, user testing, etc - and then you open up Sketch. It doesn’t matter how beautiful it is, if it doesn’t solve the user’s problem, it’s failed.</p>

<h3>Be a fast learner who enjoys picking up new ideas and tools.</h3>
<p id="short">Adapt or die. Or be bored, I always find learning fun.</p>

<h3>Be proficient (or willing to learn fast) with Sketch. If you are good at AI or AE we’ll love you even more.</h3>

<p>I’ve played around with the sketch trial, but I’ve never used it for a proper project. However one thing I’ve learnt at uni is that you can learn any program with 3 days and enough focus. AI was the first design program I ever used, about 7 years ago now. I’ve used after effects for video titles, but i’m willing to learn more.</p>

<h3>Design for fun, in and out of work.</h3>
<p>I honestly just love design. I’ve been studying design at university for 3 years, and have gotten straight A’s for two and a half years. The reason is because I simply love it.</p>

<h3>Be a bit flexible; we’re a young startup and you’ll be designing lots of different stuff.</h3>
<p>I will attempt anything and everything you throw at me. I know from experience that in a startup you have to be flexible enough to do almost any job. I’m also physically flexible, I can still put my foot behind my head</p>

        <div class="g">
          <div class="g-33 one">
            <p><b>User Focused Design</b></p>
<p>I believe there's three key steps to making a great design. Understanding the user, understanding the problem, and execution. I find those first two steps really fascinating, and I’ve spent a lot of time focusing on them in my personal work, and at university.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="g-33 two">
            <p><b>Interfaces</b></p>
<p>I really love interfaces. I’ve wanted to design interfaces since I was a kid (which is strange ambition). They just seemed to be that perfect blend of people, computers, and design. I love all interfaces, but I have most experience with interfaces for web.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="g-33 three">
            <p><b>Front End Development</b></p>
<p>I got into front end development because I wanted to be able to design something, then build it. I found web technologies were the easiest way to get started. Experience with Css / Sass, React, Javascript and plain old HTML.</p>

        <h2>A bit about me</h2> 
        <p>I’m tall, ginger, 21, live in <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington">Wellington</a>. I just finished my <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/study/programmes-courses/undergraduates/bachelors-degrees/design-innovation">Bachelor of Design Innovation</a>, and I’m part way through a computer science minor. I’ve worked at a local startup <a  target="_blank" href="http://hoist.io/">Hoist.io</a>, and I currently work at a software development shop called <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.end-game.com/">EndGame</a>. I’ve got a pretty sweet life here in New Zealand - so why would I consider moving 18,764 kms to London?</p>

        <p>Simply because I see what a project like mondo could be in the future. It’s inevitable fully digital banks become a reality, it’s just more efficient. Mondo is a project which excites me, it’s building a product I really want to use.</p>

        <p>I’m already enrolled in Masters of Design program for this year, and I’m not actively looking for work. But i’m applying to this job because it’s too exciting of an opportunity to pass up. I realise there will be heaps of applicants who have stronger portfolios. And more experience. But the one thing I have, is that I understand mondo’s vision.</p>
